command center for a node.

wait for a node to revert, and :
reset the network -> "hardcoded"
update itself from  git://github.scm.corp.ebay.com/euqe-team/commandCenter.git -> "hardcoded"
let the hub know it's ready to receive command -> depends on what was pulled 

Command are then executed by a python server. See startCommandCenterServer.py
